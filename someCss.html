		<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>	I was born in Hawaii and rasied in Seattle.</p>
			<p> My favorite meal is pizza with beer on the side.</p>
			<p> Here is a poem from Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken</p>
			
			<p style="font-family:courier;"> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	And looked down one as far as I could
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;

	Then took the other, as just as fair,
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	Though as for that the passing there
	Had worn them really about the same,

	And both that morning equally lay
	In leaves no step had trodden black.
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
	I doubted if I should ever come back.

	I shall be telling this with a sigh
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
	I took the one less traveled by,
	And that has made all the difference.</p>
